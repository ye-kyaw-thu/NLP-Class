<h1>The UMIACS Word Alignment Interface</h1>

<h2>Introduction: </h2>
<pre>
This is an improved version of the alignment interface that <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/">Rebecca Hwa</a> had written when she was a postdoc at UMIACS.
I liked the appearence of the interface a lot but I wanted to incorporate some of the functionality that Blinker
(another <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/melamed98manual.html">alignment interface</a> written by Dan Melamed) provided. So, I rewrote some of the underlying code to get us
that functionality.Along the way, I also made some cosmetic changes to make the interface look and behave better
(e.g., dialog boxes etc).
