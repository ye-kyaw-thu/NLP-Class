Anbo completes construction of China 's modern , colored glass-shell industrial base 
The second construction phase of the Anyang Color Kinescope Glass-Shell Co. , Ltd. , designed and built using Chinese initiative , and meeting current world-wide advanced technological levels , today finished construction and started operations .
The Vice Premier of the State Council , Zou Jia-hua , attended the ribbon cutting ceremony held today for the start of operations .
The Anbo company is a key project in China 's nationalization of the production of color TVs , which China built up during the " 75 " period ( 1986 - 1990 ) with wholesale introduction of foreign advanced technology and implementation of general technological contracts from outside .
Since starting production , cumulatively it has realized composite economic benefits of 1.06 billion yuan and earned 48.56 million US $ through exports and remittances , which is enough to recoup the total fixed investment of the first project phase .
According to measurements and calculations , the actual investment in Anbo 's second project phase only amounted to one-half of what the total investment would be for a comparable project that at present domestically would be built using a wholesale introduction of foreign techniques and equipment .

International Monetary Fund lowers forecast of world economic growth 
On the 21 st , the International Monetary Fund released here a provisional assessment report , and once again lowered its forecast for the speed of growth of the world economy for this year and next year .
The report held that the effect that the Asian banking crisis was having on the world economy was even more serious than previously estimated .
It estimated that for the world economy this year 's rate of growth would be 4.1 % , next year falling to 3.5 % , and that this year is the year with the slowest growth in the last 5 years .
Compared to the forecast that the above-mentioned organization published in October , this is lower by 0.1 and 0.8 percentage points , respectively .
The IMF furthermore lowered the forecasts of next year 's economic growth for a large number of regions and countries .
According to its newest estimates , the rate of economic growth of industrialized countries this year will be 3.9 % and next year it will be 3.6 % .
Among them , America 's rate of economic growth next year will fall from this year 's 3.8 % down to 2.4 % , and Japan 's rate of economic growth next year will be only 1.1 % .
It estimated that the developing countries ' economies will grow 5.9 % this year , and next year will only grow 4.9 % , lower by 1.3 percentage points compared to the October estimate .
Among them , the rates of growth for this year and last year for the Asian regions are estimated at 6.8 % and 5.7 % , respectively , lower by 0.9 and 1.7 percentage points compared to the previous forecast .
The economic growth of such countries as Korea , Thailand , Indonesia , Malaysia , and the Philippines all will clearly slow down .
The IMF also made a new forecast for trends in world trade in commodities and labor .
It estimated the extent of growth in global trade this year to be 8.6 % , dropping to 6.2 % next year .
Within this , the extent of trade growth for industrialized countries this year and next year will be 9.3 % and 6.1 % , and the extent of growth for developing countries will be 9.6 % and 7.7 % .
If reform measures are not effective , a crisis of confidence will still exist , and in that case there is the possibility that investors will turn their attention to other , newly rising markets .
Japanese economist says the actual rate of growth of the world economy this year will be about 3 %
Nakamura Kazuo , Director of Research at Japan 's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank , said here today that the real growth rate of the world economy in 1998 will be about 3 % .
Nakamura Kazuo , at a public lecture jointly organized by Beijing 's Wu Jia Economic Consulting Company , Ltd. and Japan 's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank , made a report concerning the new year 's world economic and financial situation .
Compared with the rapid growth of the past , the world economy has entered a period of adjustment .
He forecast that the real growth rate for the world economy this year would fall from the 3.9 % of '97 down to 3 % .
Nakamura thought that the rate of economic growth of Asia 's countries and regions , with Korea and Thailand being the most prominent , would slide downward to a large extent .
But , he said , for these countries the currencies already have devalued to a great degree , exports have recovered , and imports could decrease .
Because of this , he expected that their economies would slip downward to the lowest point in the next half year .
He estimated that the rate of economic growth in ASEAN would be about 4.5 percent .
Nakamura said that the Japanese economy exhibited negative growth in the year '97 , and that in '98 , if it didn not adopt good economic policies , the economy would continue to be in negative growth .
He estimated it would be negative 0.5 percent , plus or minus .
He said further that China 's economic growth would also slow in speed , feeling the effects of the economies of Japan and Asia being depressed and of the devaluation of these countries ' currencies .
But because China 's usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition it has over 100 billion US $ in foreign exchange reserves , it isn not likely to sink into the crisis like the other Asian nations .

Mount Fuji Travel Ballad 
Mount Fuji is only 80 kilometers from Tokyo -- this obviously was also specially arranged by good fortune : this island nation 's highest mountain and her largest city depend on one another as partners and mutually reflect one another .
Thereupon , like a light boat on a familiar route , the large tour bus that we rode raced directly toward the southwest -- the direction of Mount Fuji .
Without anyone being aware of it , the dense forest almost completely sealed the road off from the sky above . It turned out that the road had already narrowed , moreover it was sloping .
One look out the window was enough for one to know that the bus was already suspended half way up the mountain ! 
The tour guide was urging everyone to board the bus .
I asked her : how long would it take to climb to the summit from here on foot ? 
She replied proclaiming : 4 to 7 hours ! 
I extended my tongue and raised my head , imagining and hoping for a glance at the summit , but only saw clouds wafting in the air . I saw no lofty mountain peak .
Thereupon , I agitatedly got up and asked the tour guide : " Why are we going back after only just getting half way up the mountain ? " 
She said : " Touring Mount Fuji doesn not at all imply mountain climbing .
What 's more , Fuji 's scenery is not all concentrated at the summit y ' know . The scenic spots at the foot of the mountain are plentiful ! " 
So evidently the bus really was carrying us down the mountain !
For an instant , a sigh of regret for " great aspirations difficult to fulfill " overwhelmed me ! 
Because I ' d already come across a face that resembled an old man of lofty mountains many times .
At a spacious and luxurious restaurant at the foot of Fuji we ate a definitely not sumptuous western meal .
Everyone hurriedly cast aside cups and plates , then without leave went nearby and viewed and enjoyed the famous first of " Fuji 's Five Lakes , " Lake Kawaguchi , and the enchanting sights of its surroundings .
At this time the weather got overcast and the water of the lake was still like a mirror , causing people to think of our country 's Jiuzhaigou 's Mirror Lake , and with the result that it had a kind of special , mysterious flavor .
After some hours we then arrived at the famous Hakone scenic area that together with Fuji belongs to Izu Park . The volcano 's wonders appeared prominently before our eyes .
The " fire " had already been dormant for 400,000 years , yet vapors rising everywhere and crystal clear , boiling hot springs testified to her vitality and power .
The volcano lake , seven kilometers in circumference , below not far away --- Reed Lake , forms a splendorous contrast with it .
Because beauty really doesn not lie in the time of the realization of a desire but lives profoundly in the yearning for the goal .
If I had ascended this dangerous peak that day then perhaps this " sacred mountain " then would lose her eternal enchantment .
Israel 's Foreign Minister writes a preface to the Chinese edition of his book " The New Middle East "
Israel 's Foreign Minister , Shimon Peres , said that China , by persevering in going its own way , and concentrating its efforts on conquering poverty set an example for the people of every country of the Middle East .
This is what Peres said in the preface he composed especially for the Chinese edition of his just published new work " The New Middle East . "
Peres said : " China and Israel are at the two ends of Asia , separated by ' ten thousand crags and torrents . ' 
Yet the people of our two countries nevertheless are similar to one another .
The great Chinese people offered up to the world cultural riches on the spiritual plane and material plane .
If these riches didn not exist , people would not be able to describe the course of history . " 
He continued on to say : " We who live in western Asia are gazing at the east with a look of hope and reverence .
China has already demonstrated to the entire world that the strategy for resolving the question of poverty in society lies in carrying out a plan that has been reasoned out and in concentrating strength towards a task that has a reasonable hope of success .
China still believes in the path that it itself has specified .
In the past it has not yielded to any pressure from outside , and now it still unswervingly defends the right to determine its own future for itself . "
The book " The New Middle East " originally was published as an English edition around the end of autumn last year .
In the preface to the Chinese edition , Peres says that the leaders of every country must have vision , relinquish old grudges , and create peace in order to deal with " challenges of tomorrow . " 
He points out , " At a time when we are on the threshold of the 21 st century , warfare no longer has any use .
The important problems we are up against are how to conquer poverty and scarcity . " 
To do this , he emphasized , " We must control the desert that is day-by-day eroding arable land , develop new sources of water , and carry out new engineering projects . "
Peres pointed out that these goals are not likely to be realized easily . They require a sensible attitude and a dedicated spirit .
He observed , " China has already demonstrated that it could conquer poverty and the misery that generations of people have suffered .
We hope that China becomes a model that the people of all Middle Eastern countries , including both Israelis and Arabs , can imitate on the road that we walk together heading towards the future .
The Chinese edition of the book " The New Middle East " has already recently been published and distributed through Xinhua Publishing .
